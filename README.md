# Learn to Code

This repository contains files I used during our "Learn to Code" program at Chattahoochee Valley Libraries. 

We had three sessions. Each one focused on a different topic and is represented by a folder in this repository.

## [Part 1: HTML](/part1-html/)

Files [`index.html`](/part1-html/index.html) and [`about.html`](/part1-html/about.html) contain the completed code from the end of the session. 

Files [`index-blank.html`](/part1-html/index-blank.html) and [`about-blank.html`](/part1-html/about-blank.html) are the templates given to students to make their own.

## [Part 2: CSS](/part2-css/)

File [`index.html`](/part2-css/index.html) contain the completed code from the end of the session. 

File [`index-blank.html`](/part2-css/index-blank.html) is the template given to students to make their own.

## [Part 3: JavaScript](/part3-javascript)

Files [`script.js`](/part3-javascript/script.js) and [`index.html`](/part3-javascript/index.html) contain the completed code from the end of the session. 

File [`index-blank.html`](/part3-javascript/index-blank.html) is the template given to students to make their own. The template for `script.js` was blank file.
